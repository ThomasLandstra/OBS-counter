The OBS text counter is a tool that simply increments or decrements a value when a keybind is pressed. This tool is useful to track anything from the number of kills and deaths you have, to the number of donations received.

## How to use

Drag the counter.txt into OBS or SLOBS and run main.py answering the prompts as they appear.

## Keybinds

Keybinds must not have spaces in them. Keybinds must be written like this: "space+ctrl+l".
